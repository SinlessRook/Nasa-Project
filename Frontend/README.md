# Climate Change Story

## Overview

This project is a climate change story web application created as part of the NASA Space Apps Hackathon. It utilizes React with Vite for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS, and a Flask backend to manage data.

## Features

- **Interactive Storytelling**: Engage users with an interactive narrative about climate change.
- **Dynamic Data**: Fetch and display real-time data related to climate change.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-friendly layout designed with Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.

- **Backend**:
  - **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Python (v3.6 or later)

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the frontend and `http://localhost:5000` for the backend (if you're using the default Flask settings).
